				<div>
				<li>Born on February 22,1962, in Essedon,Melbourne,Victoria,Austrailia.</li>
				<li>Irwin became world-famous for his TV series The Crocodile Hunter</li>
				<li>He even had his own catchphrase—"Crikey!"—an Australian expression of surprise or excitement.</li>
				<li>Irwin occasionally drew criticism for his stunts. Some said that he was exploiting the animals that appeared on his shows.</li>
				<li>He stirred up even greater controversy in 2004 for feeding a crocodile while holding his infant son.</li>
				<li>He had grown up in a zoo environment and wanted the same experience for his son, Robert, and his daughter, Bindi Sue.</li>
				<li>Always in his trademark khaki shirt and shorts, Irwin became a well-known figure in popular culture.</li>
				<li>He thought nothing of tangling with deadly snakes, spiders, lizards, and, of course, crocodiles. </li>
				<li>In addition to his hair-raising adventures, Irwin considered himself a wildlife educator, sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm for animals with his viewers.</li>
				<li>Irwin met American-born Terri Raines, who in was in Australia on vacation, in 1991. The couple later married and spent part of their honeymoon filming crocodiles.</li>
				<li>While he had no scientific degree, he grew up studying and caring for animals at his parents' wildlife park, which is now known as the Australia Zoo. </li>
				<li>On September 4, 2006, Irwin was filming a new program off the coast of Port Douglas in Queensland, Australia. Snorkeling near a stingray, he was pierced in the chest by its barb, which hit his heart. Irwin died of cardiac arrest shortly after being stung.</li>
